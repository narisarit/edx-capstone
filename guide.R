Great! You're working with a version of the MovieLens dataset, and the project rubric is clear. Here's a structured guide to help you meet all the requirements:
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔧 Files (10 points)
  You need to submit:
  1. `recommendation.Rmd` – The main analysis report in R Markdown.
2. `recommendation.pdf` – Knit the Rmd file to PDF.
3. `recommendation.R` – The script version of your code (can be a cleaned-up version of the Rmd).

  ## 🧠 Report Structure (40 points)
  
  ### 📌 1. Introduction / Overview
  Include:
  - A brief description of the dataset.
- The purpose of the recommendation system.
- The goal: **minimize RMSE on the final hold-out test set**.
- Summary of key steps: data cleaning, EDA, modeling, evaluation.

### 🔍 2. Methods / Analysis
Break this into sub-sections:
  #### 📁 Data Cleaning
  - Remove duplicates (if any).
- Ensure data types are correct.
- Split data into **training** and **validation (final_holdout_test)** sets.

#### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Count unique users and movies.
- Average ratings per movie and user.
- Visualizations: histograms, density plots, genre frequency, time trend of ratings.

#### 🧠 Modeling Approach
Start from simple to more complex:
  1. **Naive Model** (predict average rating)
2. **Movie Effect Model**
  3. **Movie + User Effect Model**
  4. **Regularized Movie + User Model**
  5. **Matrix Factorization using `recosystem`**
  
  Each step should improve RMSE. Example for regularization:
  ```r
lambdas <- seq(0, 10, 0.25)
rmses <- sapply(lambdas, function(l) {
  # compute regularized means and RMSE on training/validation sets
})
```

  ## 📈 Results (RMSE - 25 points)
  - Present RMSE for each model.
- Include a plot of RMSE vs. model type.
- Final RMSE on `final_holdout_test`.
- For full credit, aim for **RMSE < 0.86490**

  ## 🧾 Conclusion
  - Recap what worked well.
- Note limitations: e.g., cold-start problem, timestamp not used, no content-based filtering.
- Future improvements: use more features, hybrid models, deep learning, etc.

---
  
  ## 🧼 Code Quality (25 points)
  - Use comments generously.
- Organize code into clear sections.
- Consider separating modeling functions to keep the main script clean.
